Synopsis: 
In the small city of Nanao, insomniac Ganta Nakami tries to catch a nap in his school's abandoned astronomical observatory. There he stumbles upon a sociable and carefree girl named Isaki Magari who has the same problem. The two form an awkward friendship and reestablish their school's defunct astronomy club.

It is a wonderfully written manga that stands out from other seinen, slife of life romance mangas out there. It may have a common trope, like a shy male protagonist and an extroverted female protagonist but both of them are wonderfully written. You can understand what made them fall inlove to each other and their personal motivations. The visuals is also good like how a simple drawing of nature can be so calm and peaceful.
